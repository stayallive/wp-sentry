# [WordPress Sentry](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-sentry-integration/) (wp-sentry)

A (unofficial) [WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-sentry-integration/) to report PHP and JavaScript errors to [Sentry](https://sentry.io).


## What?

This plugin can report PHP errors (optionally) and JavaScript errors (optionally) to [Sentry](https://sentry.io) and integrates with its release tracking.

It will auto detect authenticated users and add context where possible. All context/tags can be adjusted using filters mentioned below.


## Requirements

This plugin requires PHP `7.2`+ but urges users to use a PHP version that is not end of life (EOL) and no longer supported. For an up-to-date list of PHP versions that are still supported see: http://php.net/supported-versions.php.

- Version `2.1.*` of this plugin will be the last to support PHP `5.3`.
- Version `2.2.*` of this plugin will be the last to support PHP `5.4`.
- Version `3.11.*` of this plugin will be the last to support PHP `7.1`.

**Note:** Version `5.x` is the most recent version of the wp-sentry plugin and only supports PHP `7.2` and up. If you need PHP `5.4-7.1` support check out version `2.x` or `3.x` but do keep in mind there are a lot of differences in the Sentry PHP SDK used.

- Version [`2.x`](https://github.com/stayallive/wp-sentry/tree/2.x) of the wp-sentry plugin uses the [`1.x`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php/tree/1.x) version of the official Sentry PHP SDK.
- Version [`3.x`](https://github.com/stayallive/wp-sentry/tree/3.x) of the wp-sentry plugin uses the [`2.x`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php/tree/2.x) version of the official Sentry PHP SDK.
- Version [`4.x`](https://github.com/stayallive/wp-sentry/tree/4.x), [`5.x`](https://github.com/stayallive/wp-sentry/tree/5.x), & [`6.x`](https://github.com/stayallive/wp-sentry/tree/6.x) of the wp-sentry plugin uses the [`3.x`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php/tree/3.x) version of the official Sentry PHP SDK.
- Version [`7.x`](https://github.com/stayallive/wp-sentry/tree/master)+ of the wp-sentry plugin uses the [`4.x`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php/tree/master) version of the official Sentry PHP SDK.


## Usage

There are a couple of options to start using the plugin.

**Note:** This plugin does not do anything by default and only has a diagnostic admin interface to test if you have setup the DSN properly and send test events. Setting up the DSN is required.

### WordPress plugin repository

1. Install this plugin from the WordPress plugin repository: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-sentry-integration/
2. Configure your DSN as explained in the [configuration](#configuration) section
3. Activate the plugin through the WordPress admin interface or wp-cli

### Manual plugin installation

1. Download the plugin from the [releases page](https://github.com/stayallive/wp-sentry/releases)
2. Extract it and place the folder in your `wp-content/plugins` folder
3. Configure your DSN as explained in the [configuration](#configuration) section
4. Activate the plugin through the WordPress admin interface or wp-cli

### Using composer

1. Run `composer require stayallive/wp-sentry` in your project
2. Configure your DSN as explained in the [configuration](#configuration) section
3. Activate the plugin through the WordPress admin interface or wp-cli


## Configuration

To start using the plugin first setup the [DSN](#dsn) for either the PHP side or the Browser side or both.

All other configuration options are optional but it's advised you read through them to see if any are applicable to you or are thing you'd like to configure.

**Note:** When configuring constants in your `wp-config.php` do this **before** the `That's all, stop editing! Happy publishing.` line, otherwise they won't work!

### DSN

Sentry uses something called a DSN ([read more](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/)) to configure the SDK.

#### `WP_SENTRY_PHP_DSN` (PHP)

To track PHP errors add this snippet to your `wp-config.php` and replace `PHP_DSN` with your actual DSN that you find inside Sentry in the project settings under "Client Keys (DSN)":

```php
define( 'WP_SENTRY_PHP_DSN', 'PHP_DSN' );
```

**Note:** Do not set this constant to disable the PHP tracker.

**Note:** This constant was previously called `WP_SENTRY_DSN` and is still supported.

#### `WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_DSN` (Browser)

To track JavaScript errors add this snippet to your `wp-config.php` and replace `JS_DSN` with your actual DSN that you find inside Sentry in the project settings under "Client Keys (DSN)":

```php
define( 'WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_DSN', 'JS_DSN' );

// You can _optionally_ enable or disable the JavaScript tracker in certain parts of your site with these constants:
define('WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_ADMIN_ENABLED', true);    // Add the JavaScript tracker to the admin area. Default: true
define('WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_LOGIN_ENABLED', true);    // Add the JavaScript tracker to the login page. Default: true
define('WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_FRONTEND_ENABLED', true); // Add the JavaScript tracker to the front end. Default: true
```

**Note:** Do not set this constant to disable the JavaScript tracker.

**Note:** This constant was previously called `WP_SENTRY_PUBLIC_DSN` and is still supported.

### Privacy

#### `WP_SENTRY_SEND_DEFAULT_PII`

If this flag is enabled, certain personally identifiable information is added by active integrations. Without this flag they are never added to the event, to begin with.

If possible, itâ€™s recommended to turn on this feature and use the server side PII stripping to remove the values instead.

When enabled the current logged in user and IP address will be added to the event.

```php
define( 'WP_SENTRY_SEND_DEFAULT_PII', true );
```

### Options

#### `WP_SENTRY_VERSION`

Define a version of your site. By default the active theme version will be used or `unspecified` if theme version could not be resolved.

This is used for tracking at which version of your site the error occurred. When combined with release tracking this is a very powerful feature.

```php
define( 'WP_SENTRY_VERSION', 'v7.16.0' );
```

#### `WP_SENTRY_ENV`

Define an environment of your site. Defaults to the WordPress environment type from `wp_get_environment_type()` or `unspecified` if none configured.

This is used for tracking on which environment of your site the error occurred.

```php
define( 'WP_SENTRY_ENV', 'production' );
```

#### `WP_SENTRY_ERROR_TYPES` (PHP)

Set the error types the PHP tracker will track:

```php
define( 'WP_SENTRY_ERROR_TYPES', E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_USER_DEPRECATED & ~E_USER_NOTICE );
```

**Note**: You can set any combination of error types you want, see the [PHP documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.constants.php) for more information.

### Set Up Tracing

#### `WP_SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` (PHP)

Set the desired sampling rate for performane tracing. Replace `0.3` with your desired sampling rate (`0.3` means sample ~30% of your traffic):

```php
// https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/performance/#configure
define( 'WP_SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE', 0.3 ); // traces_sample_rate
```

Enabling tracing will also set `SAVEQUERIES`, this can use more memory to save all the executed queries in your environment. If this is not desirable you can disable query tracing by configuring `WP_SENTRY_TRACING_FEATURES`.

**Note:** Do not set this constant or set the sample rate to `0.0` to disable the performance monitoring.

#### `WP_SENTRY_TRACING_FEATURES` (PHP)

Enable performance monitoring features by adding this snippet to your `wp-config.php`:

```php
define( 'WP_SENTRY_TRACING_FEATURES', [
	'db' => [
		'spans' => true,
		'breadcrumbs' => defined( 'SAVEQUERIES' ) && SAVEQUERIES,
	],
	'http' => [
		'spans' => true,
		'breadcrumbs' => true,
	],
	'transients' => [
		'spans' => true,
		'breadcrumbs' => true,
	],
] );
```

**Note:** Not configuring this constant will default to the above configuration.

#### `WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` (Browser)

Enable JavaScript performance tracing by adding this snippet to your `wp-config.php` and replace `0.3` with your desired sampling rate (`0.3` means sample ~30% of your traffic):

```php
// https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/performance/#configure-the-sample-rate
define( 'WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE', 0.3 ); // tracesSampleRate

// These options are passed directly to `new BrowserTracing({})`
// define( 'WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_TRACING_OPTIONS', [] );
```

**Note:** Do not set this constant or set the sample rate to `0.0` to disable the JavaScript performance tracing.

#### `WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_REPLAYS_SESSION_SAMPLE_RATE` (Browser)

Enable JavaScript Session Replay by adding this snippet to your `wp-config.php` and replace `0.3` with your desired sampling rate (`0.3` means sample ~30% of your traffic):

```php
// These options are injected into the `Sentry.init()` call
// https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/configuration/#general-integration-configuration
define( 'WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_REPLAYS_SESSION_SAMPLE_RATE', 0.1 ); // replaysSessionSampleRate
define( 'WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_REPLAYS_ON_ERROR_SAMPLE_RATE', 1.0 ); // replaysOnErrorSampleRate

// These options are passed directly to `new Replay({})`
// - https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/configuration/#general-integration-configuration
// - https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/session-replay/privacy/#privacy-configuration
// define( 'WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_SESSION_REPLAY_OPTIONS', [ 'maskAllText' => true ] );
```

**Note:** Do not set these constants or set the sample rates to `0.0` to disable the JavaScript Session Replay.

**Note:** This feature is not available if the ES5 bundles are enabled with `WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_USE_ES5_BUNDLES`.

#### `WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_USE_ES5_BUNDLES` (Browser)

Enable JavaScript ES5 compatible bundles, required if you need to support older browsers (for example IE11):

```php
define( 'WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_USE_ES5_BUNDLES', true );
```

**Note:** Enabling this also loads a external polyfill resource hosted by [Polyfill.io](https://polyfill.io/v3/) that is required.

**Note:** Enabling this will disable Session Replay if enabled since it has no ES5 compatible bundles.

### Set Up Profiling

#### `WP_SENTRY_PROFILES_SAMPLE_RATE` (PHP)

**Note:** This feature requires the Excimer PHP extension to be installed. See the [Sentry PHP SDK documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/profiling/#configure) for more information.

Sentry's tracing has to be enabled in order for profiling to work. So you also need to configure `WP_SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` to enable profiling.

Set the desired sampling rate for profiling. Replace `0.3` with your desired sampling rate (`0.3` means sample ~30% of your traffic):

```php
define( 'WP_SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE', 0.3 ); // traces_sample_rate
// https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/profiling/#configure
define( 'WP_SENTRY_PROFILES_SAMPLE_RATE', 0.3 ); // profiles_sample_rate
```

**Note:** Do not set this constant or set the sample rate to `0.0` to disable the performance monitoring.


## Filters

This plugin provides the following filters to plugin/theme developers.

**Note:** Some filters are fired when the Sentry trackers are initialised so they won't fire if you define them in your theme or in a plugin that loads after WP Sentry does.

### Common to PHP & Browser

#### `wp_sentry_user_context` (array)

You can use this filter to extend the Sentry user context for both PHP and JS trackers.

> **WARNING:** These values are exposed to the public in the JS tracker, so make sure you do not expose anything private!

Example usage:

```php
add_filter( 'wp_sentry_user_context', function ( array $user ) {
	return array_merge( $user, array(
		'a-custom-user-meta-key' => 'custom value',
	));
} );
```

**Note:** _This filter fires on the WordPress `set_current_user` action and only if the `WP_SENTRY_SEND_DEFAULT_PII` constant is set to `true`._

### Specific to PHP

#### `wp_sentry_dsn` (string)

You can use this filter to override the Sentry DSN used for the PHP tracker.

> **WARNING:** This is not recommended, please set the DSN using the `WP_SENTRY_PHP_DSN` constant in your `wp-config.php`!

Example usage:

```php
add_filter( 'wp_sentry_dsn', function ( $dsn ) {
	return 'https://<key>:<secret>@sentry.io/<project>';
} );
```

**Note:** _This filter fires on the WordPress `after_setup_theme` action. It is discouraged to use this and instead define the DSN in the `wp-config.php` using the `WP_SENTRY_PHP_DSN` constant_

---

#### `wp_sentry_scope` (void)

You can use this filter to customize the Sentry [scope](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/enriching-events/context/).

Example usage:

```php
add_filter( 'wp_sentry_scope', function ( \Sentry\State\Scope $scope ) {
	$scope->setTag('my-custom-tag', 'tag-value');

	return $scope;
} );
```

**Note:** _This filter fires on the WordPress `after_setup_theme` action._

---

#### `wp_sentry_options`

You can use this filter to customize the Sentry [options](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/configuration/options/).

Example usage:

```php
add_filter( 'wp_sentry_options', function ( \Sentry\Options $options ) {
	// Only sample 90% of the events
	$options->setSampleRate(0.9);

	return $options;
} );
```

**Note:** _This filter fires on the WordPress `after_setup_theme` action._

---

#### `wp_sentry_before_send`

You can use this filter to filter error events sent to Sentry. Read more about [filtering in the docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/configuration/filtering/#filtering-error-events).

Example usage:

```php
add_filter( 'wp_sentry_before_send', function ( \Sentry\Event $event, ?\Sentry\EventHint $hint = null ) {
    // Don't send error event with level `warning` for the Hello Dolly example plugin
    if ( $hint->exception !== null && $event->getLevel() === \Sentry\Severity::warning() && strpos( $hint->exception->getFile(), 'plugins/hello.php' ) !== false ) {
        return null;
    }
    
    return $event;
}, 2 );
```

**Note:** _Do not forget to return the `$event` if you want to send it to Sentry, returning `null` discards the event._

### Specific to Browser

#### `wp_sentry_public_dsn` (string)

You can use this filter to override the Sentry DSN used for the JS tracker.

> **WARNING:** This is not recommended, please set the DSN using the `WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_DSN` constant in your `wp-config.php`!

Example usage:

```php
add_filter( 'wp_sentry_public_dsn', function ( $dsn ) {
	return 'https://<key>@sentry.io/<project>';
} );
```

#### `wp_sentry_public_options` (array)

You can use this filter to customize/override the Sentry [options](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/configuration/options/) used to initialize the JS tracker.

> **WARNING:** These values are exposed to the public, so make sure you do not expose anything private !

Example usage:

```php
add_filter( 'wp_sentry_public_options', function ( array $options ) {
	return array_merge( $options, array(
		'sampleRate' => '0.5',
		'denyUrls' => array(
			'https://github.com/',
			'regex:\\w+\\.example\\.com',
		),
	));
} );
```

**Note:** _Items prefixed with `regex:` in `denyUrls`, `allowUrls` and `ignoreErrors` option arrays will be translated into pure RegExp._

#### `wp_sentry_public_context` (array)

You can use this filter to customize/override the Sentry context, you can modify the `user`, `tags` and `extra` context.

> **WARNING:** These values are exposed to the public, so make sure you do not expose anything private !

Example usage:

```php
add_filter( 'wp_sentry_public_context', function ( array $context ) {
	$context['tags']['my-custom-tag'] = 'tag-value';

	return $context;
} );
```


## Advanced usages

### High volume of notices

Many plugin in the WordPress ecosystem generate notices that are captured by the Sentry plugin.

This can cause a high volume of events and even slower page loads because of those events being transmitted to Sentry.

The prevent this you can set the following in your `wp-config.php` to filter out errors of the notice type.

```php
define( 'WP_SENTRY_ERROR_TYPES', E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_USER_NOTICE );
```

**Note**: You can set any combination of error types you want, see the [PHP documentation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.constants.php) for more information.

### Capturing handled exceptions

The best thing to do with an exception is to capture it yourself, however you might still want to know about it.

The Sentry plugin only captures unhandled exceptions and fatal errors, to capture handled exception you can do the following:

```php
try {
	myMethodThatCanThrowAnException();
} catch ( \Exception $e ) {
	// We are using wp_sentry_safe to make sure this code runs even if the Sentry plugin is disabled
	if ( function_exists( 'wp_sentry_safe' ) ) {
		wp_sentry_safe( function ( \Sentry\State\HubInterface $client ) use ( $e ) {
			$client->captureException( $e );
		} );
	}

	wp_die( 'There was an error doing this thing you were doing, we have been notified!' );
}
```

If you need to attach extra data only for the handled exception, you could add [Structured Context](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/enriching-events/context/#structured-context):

```php
$e = new Exception('Some exception I want to capture with extra data.');

if (function_exists('wp_sentry_safe')) {
	wp_sentry_safe(function (\Sentry\State\HubInterface $client) use ($e) {
		$client->withScope(function (\Sentry\State\Scope $scope) use ($client, $e) {
			$scope->setContext('user_data', $e->getData());
			$client->captureException($e);
		});
	});
}
```

If you need to add data to the scope in every case use `configureScope` in [wp_sentry_scope filter](#wp_sentry_scope-void).

### Loading Sentry before WordPress

Since WP Sentry is a WordPress plugin it loads after WordPress and unless you are using a must-use plugin (see [Capturing plugin errors](#capturing-plugin-errors)) even after some other plugins loaded throwing errors which are not captured by Sentry.

To remedy this you can opt to load the plugin from your `wp-config.php` file before WordPress is started.

It's really simple to do this by adding the following snippet to your `wp-config.php` before the `/* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */` comment:

```php
// It's possible your WordPress installation is different, check to make sure this path is correct for your installation
require_once __DIR__ . '/wp-content/plugins/wp-sentry-integration/wp-sentry.php';
```

Also make sure that any configuration options like `WP_SENTRY_PHP_DSN` are set before the snippet above otherwise they have no effect.

### Capturing plugin errors

Since this plugin is called `wp-sentry-integration` it loads a bit late which could miss errors or notices occuring in plugins that load before it.

You can remedy this by loading WordPress Sentry as a must-use plugin by creating the file `wp-content/mu-plugins/wp-sentry-integration.php` (if the `mu-plugins` directory does not exist you must create that too).

```php
<?php

/**
 * Plugin Name: WordPress Sentry
 * Plugin URI: https://github.com/stayallive/wp-sentry
 * Description: A (unofficial) WordPress plugin to report PHP and JavaScript errors to Sentry.
 * Version: must-use-proxy
 * Author: Alex Bouma
 * Author URI: https://alex.bouma.dev
 * License: MIT
 */

$wp_sentry = WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/plugins/wp-sentry-integration/wp-sentry.php';

// Do not crash in case the plugin is not installed
if ( ! file_exists( $wp_sentry ) ) {
	return;
}

require $wp_sentry;
```

Now `wp-sentry-integration` will load always and before all other plugins.

**Note**: It is advised you leave the original `wp-sentry-integration` in the `/wp-content/plugins` folder to still have updates come in through the WordPress updater. However enabling or disabling does nothing if the above script is active (since it will always be enabled).

### Capturing errors only from certain theme and/or plugin

This is an example on how to use the `before_send` callback of the Sentry SDK to only capture errors occuring in a certain theme or plugin.

See also the filter docs: [wp_sentry_option](#wp_sentry_options).

```php
add_filter( 'wp_sentry_options', function ( \Sentry\Options $options ) {
	$options->setBeforeSendCallback( function ( \Sentry\Event $event ) {
		$exceptions = $event->getExceptions();

		// No exceptions in the event? Send the event to Sentry, it's most likely a log message
		if ( empty( $exceptions ) ) {
			return $event;
		}

		$stacktrace = $exceptions[0]->getStacktrace();

		// No stacktrace in the first exception? Send it to Sentry just to be safe then
		if ( $stacktrace === null ) {
			return $event;
		}

		// Little helper and fallback for PHP versions without the str_contains function
		$strContainsHelper = function ( $haystack, $needle ) {
			if ( function_exists( 'str_contains' ) ) {
				return str_contains( $haystack, $needle );
			}

			return $needle !== '' && mb_strpos( $haystack, $needle ) !== false;
		};

		foreach ( $stacktrace->getFrames() as $frame ) {
			// Check the the frame happened inside our theme or plugin
			// Change THEME_NAME and PLUGIN_NAME to whatever is required
			// And / or modify this `if` statement to detect other variables
			if ( $strContainsHelper( $frame->getFile(), 'themes/THEME_NAME' )
				 || $strContainsHelper( $frame->getFile(), 'plugins/PLUGIN_NAME' )
			) {
				// Send the event to Sentry
				return $event;
			}
		}

		// Stacktrace contained no frames in our theme and/or plugin? We send nothing to Sentry
		return null;
	} );

	return $options;
} );
```

### Client side hook

When using the Sentry Browser integration it is possible to do some work in the client browser before Sentry is initialized to change options and/or prevent the Browser SDK from initializing at all.

You do this by defining a `wp_sentry_hook` JavaScript function before the Sentry Browser JavaScript file is included (keep this function small and easy since any errors that occur in there are not tracked by the Browser SDK).

A quick example on how you would disable the Browser SDK using `wp_add_inline_script`:

```php
add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', function () {
	wp_add_inline_script( 'wp-sentry-browser', 'function wp_sentry_hook(options) { return someCheckInYourCode() ? true : false; }', 'before' );
} );
```

When the `wp_sentry_hook` function returns `false` the initialization of the Sentry Brower SDK will be stopped. Any other return value will be ignored.

To modify the options you can modify the object passed as the first argument of the `wp_sentry_hook`, this object will later be passed to `Sentry.init` to initialize the Browser SDK.

### Modifying the PHP SDK `ClientBuilder` or options before initialisation

Because the PHP SDK is initialized as quick as possible to capture early errors, it's impossible to modify the options or the `ClientBuilder` before the initialization with WordPress hooks.

There exists a way to modify the options and the `ClientBuilder` before the initialization of the PHP SDK by setting a callback using a constant called `WP_SENTRY_CLIENTBUILDER_CALLBACK`.

The callback will be executed whenever the plugin creates a new `ClientBuilder` instance to create a new PHP SDK client.

You would place the example below in your `wp-config.php` file to make sure it's available before the PHP SDK is initialized:

```php
function wp_sentry_clientbuilder_callback( \Sentry\ClientBuilder $builder ): void {
    // For example, disabling the default integrations
	$builder->getOptions()->setDefaultIntegrations( false );
}

define( 'WP_SENTRY_CLIENTBUILDER_CALLBACK', 'wp_sentry_clientbuilder_callback' );
```

### HTTP proxy

If you need to use a HTTP proxy to send events to Sentry you can setup the WordPress HTTP proxy support and this plugin will transfer those settings to the Sentry SDK.

Read more about how to setup the WordPress Proxy constants here: https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_http_proxy/#description.

There is one caveat, if you are using an HTTP proxy in WordPress but don't want Sentry to use it you should set `WP_SENTRY_PROXY_ENABLED` to `false` in your `wp-config.php`. Setting `WP_PROXY_BYPASS_HOSTS` will not work!
