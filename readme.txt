A (unofficial) WordPress plugin to report PHP errors and Browser (JavaScript) errors to Sentry.

== Description ==
This plugin can report PHP errors and Browser (JavaScript) errors to Sentry.

It will auto detect authenticated users and add context where possible. All context/tags can be adjusted/expanded using filters.

_For more information and documentation have a look at the [full documentation](https://github.com/stayallive/wp-sentry/tree/v8.2.0#readme)._

== Installation ==
It is recommended to use the plugins interface in WordPress to install this plugin.

If manual installation is required, please make sure that the plugin files are in a folder named "wp-sentry-integration" in the WordPress plugins folder, usually "wp-content/plugins".

To start using the plugin first setup the [DSN](https://github.com/stayallive/wp-sentry/tree/v8.2.0#dsn) for either the PHP side or the Browser side or both.

All other configuration options are optional but it's advised you read through them to see if any are applicable to you or are thing you'd like to configure.

_You can find more information and the full documentation: [here](https://github.com/stayallive/wp-sentry/tree/v8.2.0#configuration). The following are the basics._

**Note:** When configuring constants in your `wp-config.php` do this **before** the `That's all, stop editing! Happy publishing.` line, otherwise they won't work!

**Note:** this plugin does not do anything by default and has only a admin interface to test the integration and view it's configuration. A Sentry DSN must be configured in your `wp-config.php`.

Sentry uses something called a DSN ([read more](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/dsn-explainer/)) to configure the SDK.

To track PHP errors add this snippet to your `wp-config.php` and replace `PHP_DSN` with your actual DSN that you find inside Sentry in the project settings under "Client Keys (DSN)":

    define( 'WP_SENTRY_PHP_DSN', 'PHP_DSN' );

**Note:** Do not set this constant to disable the PHP tracker.

To track Browser (JavaScript) errors add this snippet to your `wp-config.php` and replace `JS_DSN` with your actual DSN that you find inside Sentry in the project settings under "Client Keys (DSN)":

    define( 'WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_DSN', 'JS_DSN' );

    // You can _optionally_ enable or disable the JavaScript tracker in certain parts of your site with these constants:
    define('WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_ADMIN_ENABLED', true);    // Add the JavaScript tracker to the admin area. Default: true
    define('WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_LOGIN_ENABLED', true);    // Add the JavaScript tracker to the login page. Default: true
    define('WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_FRONTEND_ENABLED', true); // Add the JavaScript tracker to the front end.  Default: true

**Note:** Do not set this constant to disable the Browser (JavaScript) tracker.

_You can find more information and the full documentation: [here](https://github.com/stayallive/wp-sentry/tree/v8.2.0#configuration). The above are the basics._

Note: This is a *breaking release* for the Browser/JavaScript SDK

We are now shipping version 8 of the browser SDK. If you don't have any custom integration with Sentry on the browser side there is nothing for you to do. But if you do please see the Browser SDK [v8 migration guide](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/migration/v7-to-v8/) and test this release.

Since this version of the plugin we no longer bundle ES5 versions of the Browser SDK, which means that if you still need to support older browsers (Internet Explorer 11 mainly) you need to stay on 7.x or bring your own ES5 compatible bundles.

* Update Sentry Browser to version 8.21.0
* Add support for the [User Feedback Widget](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/user-feedback/#user-feedback-widget). Read more about how to enable it [here](https://github.com/stayallive/wp-sentry/tree/v8.0.0#set-up-user-feedback)

Note: This is a *breaking release* for the Browser/JavaScript SDK

Since 5.0.0 of this plugin, which bundles the Browser SDK version 7, the `whitelistUrls` and `blacklistUrls` are no longer working. They are renamed to `allowUrls` and `denyUrls` respectively, please update your code if you are using those options.

Since this version of the plugin we no longer bundle the ES5 versions of the Browser SDK by default, which means that if you still need to support older browsers (Internet Explorer 11 mainly) you need to enable the new `WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_USE_ES5_BUNDLES` option by setting it to `true`. Enabling the ES5 bundles will also loads an externally hosted polyfill library for the needed polyfills.

If you are still on a WP Sentry version older than version 5.0.0 don't forget to see the Browser SDK [v7 migration guide](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/7.0.0/MIGRATION.md#upgrading-from-6x-to-7x).

* Browser: Bundle ES6 compiled browser SDK by default
* Browser: Introduce new `WP_SENTRY_BROWSER_USE_ES5_BUNDLES` flag to enable ES5 bundles + external hosted polyfill library
* Browser: Fix broken `whitelistUrls` and `blacklistUrls` which are now called `allowUrls` and `denyUrls` options (thanks @dr5hn)

= 5.2.0 =

* Update PHP SDK to version 3.7.0
* Update Sentry Browser to version 7.10.0
* Fix potential error when using `wp_sentry_options` filter when no DSN is set

= 5.1.0 =

* Update PHP SDK to version 3.6.0
* Update Sentry Browser to version 7.2.0

= 5.0.0 =

Note: This is a *breaking release* for the Browser/JavaScript SDK, please test it well and read the migration guides if applicable before upgrading!
Note: The v7 version of the JavaScript SDK requires a [self-hosted](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/) version of Sentry 20.6.0 or higher. If you are using a version of self-hosted Sentry (aka onpremise) older than 20.6.0 then you will need to [upgrade](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/releases/).

Version 7 of the Sentry JavaScript SDK brings a variety of features and fixes including bundle size and performance improvements, brand new integrations, support for the attachments API, and key bug fixes.
This release does not change or remove any top level public API methods (captureException, captureMessage), and only requires changes to certain configuration options or custom clients/integrations/transports.
For detailed overview of all the changes, please see the [v7 migration guide](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/7.0.0/MIGRATION.md#upgrading-from-6x-to-7x).
